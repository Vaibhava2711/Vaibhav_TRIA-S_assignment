## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect Vite and configure build settings
   - Click "Deploy"

Your app will be live in seconds!

### Alternative: Netlify

1. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder
   - Or connect your GitHub repo for automatic deployments

## 💡 Design Decisions & Assumptions

### Data Management
- **Mock API**: Used a simulated API call with delay to demonstrate loading states
- **In-Memory Storage**: Contacts are stored in component state (resets on page refresh)
- **Assumption**: A real application would use a backend API with persistent storage

### Search Implementation
- **Client-Side Search**: Implemented for instant results without server calls
- **Case-Insensitive**: Search works regardless of capitalization
- **Name-Only**: Currently searches only the name field as specified

### Form Validation
- **Required Fields**: All fields are mandatory for data consistency
- **Email Validation**: Uses regex pattern to ensure valid email format
- **Phone Validation**: Accepts various phone formats with numbers and common symbols
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Errors clear as user types for better UX

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Glass-Morphism**: Modern design trend for elegant, professional look
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle animations provide visual feedback
- **Color Scheme**: Blue primary color for trust and professionalism
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid adapts from 1 to 3 columns based on screen size
- **Modal for Add**: Keeps user on same page, reduces navigation complexity

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and semantic elements
- **ARIA Labels**: Screen reader support for interactive elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear visual feedback for keyboard users
